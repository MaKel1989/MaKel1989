- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaKel1989
- 👀 I’m interested in learning stuff. No special interest whatsoever, I am not going to be a pro in anything related to coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for the moment. Just checking out GitHub to keep track of my project progress.
